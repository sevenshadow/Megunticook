Open-source JavaScript Financial Modeling Module

This module is intended to allow users to easily add some equity valuation modeling to their website using only basic JavaScript.

It is also intended to be a learning tool for people who would like to learn more about equity valuation modeling.

This libary is the primary client-side financial modeling tool used by https://prudena.com

The project was created by Charlie Strout in January 2016.  Please contact Charlie if you would like to become a contributor.
